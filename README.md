> Six Degrees of Separation is the idea that you could reach any person in the world with fewer than six intermediate connections. 

> If person A knows a few people and each of them know few more non-overlapping set of people and so on and we keep a track of all these connections, by the time we reach six degrees, we would have looked at billions of people

> This is a simple in-browser simulation of the concept using the connections on Github.
> This projects builds a visualization of all the connections of a user and the connections of these connections and so on and traces a route from an n-th degree node back to the origin.

> It can serve the purpose of explaining graph algorithms in an intuitive way and visual way ( other than the purpose of helping me kill my boredom on a lazy Sunday )
